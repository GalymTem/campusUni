## Company
**Steppe Beats** is an online store for tracks and albums. Each customer has a dedicated support representative, and all sales are recorded through invoices.

## Project description (in short)
We perform SQL-based analytics on the **Chinook (PostgreSQL)** database: sales by country and customer, popularity of genres and artists, revenue trends, and support staff efficiency. Queries and results are reproducible; later we plan to add a web-based dashboard for visualization.
